# Question 11: **Correct** Implementation with **Pragmatics Kernel Language Features**
You are tasked to review the following code snippet. It is written in **MODIFIED VERSION OF C** and is intended to copy an array of Movies to a new destination in memory and sort them based on their views in ascending order using radix sort. You can assume standard libraries are included.

This modified version of C that allows for exception handling and stack tracing through the panicif keyword. The following example shows how panicif works:
```
void example_function(int* data) {
    int* int_array = malloc(sizeof(int)*10);
    panicif(int_array == NULL) {
        free(data);
    }
}
```
If the conditional statement evaluates to true, then the code block within the curly brackets is executed. Afterwards, the program logs the current stack frame to standard output and exit the program immediately, halting further code execution.

You can assume that this version of C can handle the implementation of this feature correctly without affecting the mechanisms behind other parts of the language. 
## Implementation Details
C is the language the code is written in. The version of C is modified to utilize exception handling. It is found in many languages like Java and Rust.
## Purpose of Question
This code utilizes a pragmatics kernel feature: exception handling.
