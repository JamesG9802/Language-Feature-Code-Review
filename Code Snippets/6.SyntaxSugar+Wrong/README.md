# Question 6: **Incorrect** Implementation with **Syntax Sugar Language Features**
You are tasked to review the following code snippet. It is written in **MODIFIED VERSION OF C** and is intended to copy an array of Movies to a new destination in memory and sort them based on their views in ascending order using radix sort.

This modified version of C has a new loop construct known as foreach. It is intended to be a shorthand way of writing for loops to access variables.
So 
```
int i = 0;
int A[3] = {0,1,2};
for(i = 0; i < 3; i += 1) {
    int j = A[i];
}
```
is equivalent to
```
int j;
int A[3] = {0,1,2};
for(j in A) {
}
```
You can assume that this version of C can handle the implementation of this feature correctly without affecting the mechanisms behind other parts of the language. 
## Implementation Details
C is the language the code is written in. The version of C is modified to use include construct: the foreach loop. The foreach loop is commonly found in languages like Java and Python. It allows for easy iteration through all the variables of a loop.
## Purpose of Question
This code utilizes two syntax sugar features that are commonly found in most programming languages: the foreach loop and optional curly braces for single statements.
