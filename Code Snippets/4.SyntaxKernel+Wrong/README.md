# Question 3: **Incorrect** Implementation with **Syntax Kernel Language Features**
You are tasked to review the following code snippet. It is written in C and is intended to copy an array of Movies to a new destination in memory and sort them based on their views in ascending order using radix sort.
## Implementation Details
C is the language the code is written in. The code is ANSI C90 compliant.
## Purpose of Question
This code utilizes two syntax kernel features that are commonly found in most programming languages: the switch statement and the postfix increment operator. The switch statement replaces the if/else statement to provide an alternate way of sorting numbers into buckets. The increment operator is used to enable expressions that were not possible before.
