# Question 1: **Correct** Implementation with **Generic Language Features**
You are tasked to review the following code snippet. It is written in C and is intended to copy an array of Movies to a new destination in memory and sort them based on their views in ascending order using radix sort.
## Implementation Details
C is the language the code is written in. The code is ANSI C90 compliant.
## Purpose of Question
This code snippet is the base template on which the correct variation of questions are modeled on. The code examines the classical problem of sorting an array of some data type, in this case a Movie data type, while also copying the data to an output array. To serve as a benchmark for the other questions, this questions is intended to only use generic language features[1] which include but are not limited to:
1. Primitive literals
2. Variables of primitve or object class
3. Control flow statements
4. Loop control statements
5. Methods and functions
6. Comments
7. Collections
8. Packages, namespaces, or a file organization system.
The code has been verified with our test cases.
