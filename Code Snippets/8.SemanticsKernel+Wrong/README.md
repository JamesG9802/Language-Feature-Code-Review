# Question 8: **Incorrect** Implementation with **Semantics Kernel Language Features**
You are tasked to review the following code snippet. It is written in **MODIFIED VERSION OF C** and is intended to copy an array of Movies to a new destination in memory and sort them based on their views in ascending order using radix sort.

This modified version of C that allows for dynamic typing. At run time, the types of variables can change given their usage in the code making explicitly writing variable types unnecessary unless a specific type is needed (like unsigned vs signed integers).

You can assume that this version of C can handle the implementation of this feature correctly without affecting the mechanisms behind other parts of the language. 
## Implementation Details
C is the language the code is written in. The version of C is modified to utilize implicit type inference. It is found in other languages like TypeScript for ease of use.
## Purpose of Question
This code utilizes a semantics kernel feature: implicit type inference.
